#  Customer Segmentation with Marketing Insights  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/omermohd327-svg/Customer-Segmentation-with-Marketing-Insights/blob/main/notebook/customer_segmentation.ipynb)

##  Business Problem

Modern businesses collect vast amounts of customer data but often struggle to understand customer behavior and spending patterns.

Treating all customers the same leads to:

- Inefficient marketing campaigns
- Poor customer retention
- Low personalization
- Wasted marketing budget

This project uses Machine Learning to identify distinct customer groups and generate actionable marketing insights that can improve business decision-making.

---

##  Business Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Identify meaningful customer segments
- Understand customer spending behavior
- Improve marketing effectiveness
- Enable personalized campaigns
- Increase customer retention and lifetime value
- Generate actionable business insights

---

##  Dataset

### Source

Customer Personality Analysis (Marketing Campaign) Dataset

### Raw Features (`data/raw/marketing_campaign.csv`)

- ID, Year_Birth, Education, Marital_Status
- Income, Kidhome, Teenhome, Dt_Customer, Recency
- MntWines, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts, MntSweetProducts, MntGoldProds
- NumDealsPurchases, NumWebPurchases, NumCatalogPurchases, NumStorePurchases, NumWebVisitsMonth
- Complain, Response

### Engineered Features (`data/processed/customer_segments.csv`)

- Age (from Year_Birth)
- Customer_Tenure_Days (from Dt_Customer)
- Total_Spending (sum of all Mnt* columns)
- Total_Children (Kidhome + Teenhome)
- Education collapsed into Undergraduate / Graduate / Postgraduate
- Living_With (Partner / Alone, derived from Marital_Status)
- Income, Recency, Response, and the final cluster label

These features are used to discover hidden customer patterns and group similar customers together.

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before clustering, exploratory analysis was performed to understand customer demographics and spending behavior.

![EDA Distribution](images/eda_distributions.png)

### Key Observations

- Annual income varies significantly across customers.
- Spending scores are distributed across multiple customer groups.
- Customer behavior appears heterogeneous, suggesting natural segmentation opportunities.

---

##  Correlation Analysis

A correlation heatmap was generated to understand relationships between customer attributes.

![Correlation Heatmap](images/heatmap.png)

### Insights

- Some features show weak relationships, indicating that customer behavior is influenced by multiple factors.
- Clustering can help uncover patterns that traditional correlation analysis cannot reveal.

##  Machine Learning Workflow

The project follows the following pipeline:

Exploratory Data Analysis
        ↓
Feature Selection
        ↓
Feature Scaling
        ↓

Business Insights
```

---

##  Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

- Data inspection
- Feature selection
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Preparation for clustering algorithms

Feature scaling is essential because clustering algorithms rely on distance-based calculations.

---

##  Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters

The Elbow Method was used to identify the optimal number of clusters.

### Elbow Curve

---

##  Cluster Validation using Silhouette Score

To validate cluster quality, Silhouette Analysis was performed.

### Silhouette Scores

---

##  Customer Segmentation using K-Means

After determining the optimal number of clusters, K-Means Clustering was applied.

---

##  Customer Segment Visualization

To visualize clusters effectively, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was used.

### PCA Cluster Visualization

![PCA Clusters](images/pca_clusters.png)

### Observation

Distinct customer groups can be observed, indicating meaningful segmentation within the dataset.

---

##  Customer Segment Profiles

The resulting clusters were analyzed to understand customer behavior patterns.

##  Segment Interpretation


###  Cluster 0 — Budget Families

**Characteristics**

- Lowest income (~$35.6k) and lowest spending (~$131)
- Mostly partnered, with children
- Weakest campaign response (6.2%)

**Business Strategy**

- Discount bundles
- Family-value offers
- Low priority for premium campaign spend

---

###  Cluster 1 — Established Shoppers

**Characteristics**

- Mid-to-high income (~$59.9k) and mid-to-high spending (~$796)
- Mostly partnered, prefer in-store over web purchases
- Moderate campaign response (17.4%)

**Business Strategy**

- Loyalty programs
- In-store promotions
- Targeted campaigns to grow share of wallet

---

###  Cluster 2 — Premium High-Value

**Characteristics**

- Highest income (~$74.7k) and highest spending (~$1,306)
- Fewest children
- Best campaign response (23.8%)

**Business Strategy**

- Top priority for new campaigns
- VIP memberships and early access to products
- Premium, high-touch experiences

---

###  Cluster 3 — Budget Singles

**Characteristics**

- Low income (~$38.1k) and low spending (~$183)
- Living alone
- Moderate campaign response (13.8%)

**Business Strategy**

- Low-cost entry offers
- Digital engagement to build long-term value
- Cost-effective marketing

##  Agglomerative Clustering (Comparison)

In addition to K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering was explored as an alternative clustering approach.

### Agglomerative Clustering

### Purpose

Comparing multiple clustering techniques helps evaluate segmentation consistency and cluster quality.

---

##  Business Recommendations

Based on segmentation results:

### VIP Customers

- Reward loyalty
- Offer exclusive benefits
- Increase customer lifetime value

### Opportunity Customers

- Encourage spending through personalized campaigns
- Improve customer engagement

### Budget Customers

- Focus on affordability
- Promote value-driven offerings

### Regular Customers

- Maintain engagement through targeted promotions
- Encourage repeat purchases

---

##  Key Insights

- Customer behavior naturally forms distinct groups.
- Income alone does not determine spending behavior.
- High-income customers are not always high spenders.
- Segmentation enables more effective marketing strategies.
- Data-driven customer understanding improves business outcomes.
