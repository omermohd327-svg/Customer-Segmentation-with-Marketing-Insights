#  Customer Segmentation with Marketing Insights  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/omermohd327-svg/Customer-Segmentation-with-Marketing-Insights/blob/main/notebook/customer_segmentation.ipynb)

##  Business Problem

Modern businesses collect vast amounts of customer data but often struggle to understand customer behavior and spending patterns.

Treating all customers the same leads to:

- Inefficient marketing campaigns
- Poor customer retention
- Low personalization
- Wasted marketing budget

This project uses Machine Learning to identify distinct customer groups and generate actionable marketing insights that can improve business decision-making.

---

##  Business Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Identify meaningful customer segments
- Understand customer spending behavior
- Improve marketing effectiveness
- Enable personalized campaigns
- Increase customer retention and lifetime value
- Generate actionable business insights

---

##  Dataset

### Source

Mall Customers Dataset

### Features

- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1–100)

These features are used to discover hidden customer patterns and group similar customers together.

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before clustering, exploratory analysis was performed to understand customer demographics and spending behavior.

### Key Observations

- Annual income varies significantly across customers.
- Spending scores are distributed across multiple customer groups.
- Customer behavior appears heterogeneous, suggesting natural segmentation opportunities.

---

##  Correlation Analysis

A correlation heatmap was generated to understand relationships between customer attributes.

### Insights

- Some features show weak relationships, indicating that customer behavior is influenced by multiple factors.
- Clustering can help uncover patterns that traditional correlation analysis cannot reveal.

##  Machine Learning Workflow

The project follows the following pipeline:

Business Insights
```

---

##  Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

- Data inspection
- Feature selection
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Preparation for clustering algorithms

Feature scaling is essential because clustering algorithms rely on distance-based calculations.

---

##  Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters

The Elbow Method was used to identify the optimal number of clusters.

### Elbow Curve

---

##  Cluster Validation using Silhouette Score

To validate cluster quality, Silhouette Analysis was performed.

### Silhouette Scores

---

##  Customer Segmentation using K-Means

After determining the optimal number of clusters, K-Means Clustering was applied.

---

##  Customer Segment Visualization

To visualize clusters effectively, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was used.

### PCA Cluster Visualization

### Observation

Distinct customer groups can be observed, indicating meaningful segmentation within the dataset.

---

##  Customer Segment Profiles

The resulting clusters were analyzed to understand customer behavior patterns.

##  Segment Interpretation

###  Cluster 0 — High Income, High Spending Customers

**Characteristics**

- Premium customers
- High purchasing power
- Strong engagement

**Business Strategy**

- Loyalty programs
- VIP memberships
- Premium experiences
- Early access to products

---

###  Cluster 1 — High Income, Low Spending Customers

**Characteristics**

- Financially capable customers
- Untapped spending potential

**Business Strategy**

- Personalized promotions
- Targeted campaigns
- Product recommendations

---

###  Cluster 2 — Low Income, Low Spending Customers

**Characteristics**

- Budget-conscious customers
- Lower purchasing frequency

**Business Strategy**

- Discounts
- Bundle offers
- Cost-effective marketing


---

###  Cluster 3 — Medium Income, Medium Spending Customers

**Characteristics**

- Stable customer segment
- Consistent spending behavior

**Business Strategy**

- Retention campaigns
- Cross-selling opportunities
- Seasonal promotions

---

##  Agglomerative Clustering (Comparison)

In addition to K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering was explored as an alternative clustering approach.

### Agglomerative Clustering

### Purpose

Comparing multiple clustering techniques helps evaluate segmentation consistency and cluster quality.

---

##  Business Recommendations

Based on segmentation results:

### VIP Customers

- Reward loyalty
- Offer exclusive benefits
- Increase customer lifetime value

### Opportunity Customers

- Encourage spending through personalized campaigns
- Improve customer engagement

### Budget Customers

- Focus on affordability
- Promote value-driven offerings

### Regular Customers

- Maintain engagement through targeted promotions
- Encourage repeat purchases

---

##  Key Insights

- Customer behavior naturally forms distinct groups.
- Income alone does not determine spending behavior.
- High-income customers are not always high spenders.
- Segmentation enables more effective marketing strategies.
- Data-driven customer understanding improves business outcomes.
